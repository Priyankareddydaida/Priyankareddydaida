### Hi there, I am Priyanka Sudhakar Reddy <img src="https://diginess.ca/content/uploads/2020/02/waving_hand_sign_1024.gif" width="30" />

<p>A lifelong learner and charismatic software engineer with a passion for web development.</p>
<p>
I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and take the initiative to cultivate a
collaborative environment, deliver technical solutions, and make an impact on teams, business, and
the lives of people. I constantly seek to add value to all areas for my team and my clients. When I
am not on the keyboard I am analyzing business and client needs, minimizing technical debt,
maximizing scalability and performance, focusing on user experience, and building meaningful
relationships.
